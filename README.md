# Vineflower

Vineflower is a modern, general purpose JVM language decompiler focused on providing the best quality, speed, and usability.

Vineflower's features include:
- Java 20+ support, including records, sealed classes, switch expressions, and more
- Clean code generation and output, with automatic output formatting
- Multithreaded decompilation

Examples of Vineflower's output, compared to other decompilers, can be found on [the wiki.](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower/wiki)

## Use
Want to use Vineflower? There are a few ways! For Fabric and Architectury projects, [Loom Quiltflower](https://github.com/Juuxel/LoomQuiltflower) allows you to run genSources with Vineflower.
The [Vineflower Intellij IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18032-quiltflower) replaces Fernflower in IDEA with Vineflower, and allows you to modify its settings.

If you want to run Vineflower from the commandline, head over to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower/releases) and grab the latest release.
You can then run Vineflower with `java -jar vineflower.jar <arguments> <source> <destination>`.
`<arguments>` is the list of [commandline arguments](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower/wiki) that you want to pass to the decompiler.
`<source>` can be a jar, zip, folder, or class file, and `<destination>` can be a folder, zip, jar, or excluded, to print to the console.


To use Vineflower as a library, you can find distributions on [Quilt's maven](https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/) or on maven central.
Vineflower can be imported with gradle with:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.quiltmc:quiltflower:<version>'
}
```
