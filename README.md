### Quiltflower

Quiltflower is a modern, general purpose decompiler focused on improving code quality, speed, and usability. Quiltflower is a fork of Fernflower and Forgeflower.

Changes include:
- New language features (Try with resources, switch expressions, pattern matching, and more)
- Better control flow generation (loops, try-catch, and switch, etc.)
- More configurability
- Better error messages
- Javadoc application
- Multithreading
- Optimization
- Many other miscellaneous features and fixes

### Use
Want to use Quiltflower? There are a few ways! For Fabric and Architectury projects, [Loom Quiltflower](https://github.com/Juuxel/LoomQuiltflower) allows you to run genSources with Quiltflower.
The [Quiltflower Intellij IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18032-quiltflower) replaces Fernflower in IDEA with Quiltflower, and allows you to modify its settings.
Or, if you want to run Quiltflower from the commandline, head over to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltflower/releases) and grab the latest, and then follow the instructions further down the readme.
Make sure to report any issues to the [Issues tab!](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltflower/issues)

### About Fernflower

Fernflower is the first actually working analytical decompiler for Java and 
probably for a high-level programming language in general. Naturally it is still 
under development, please send your bug reports and improvement suggestions to the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltflower/issues).

### Licence

Fernflower is licenced under the [Apache Licence Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

### Running from command line

`java -jar quiltflower.jar [-<option>=<value>]* [<source>]+ <destination>`

\* means 0 or more times\
\+ means 1 or more times

\<source>: file or directory with files to be decompiled. Directories are recursively scanned. Allowed file extensions are class, zip and jar.
          Sources prefixed with -e= mean "library" files that won't be decompiled, but taken into account when analysing relationships between 
          classes or methods. Especially renaming of identifiers (s. option 'ren') can benefit from information about external classes.          

\<destination>: destination directory 

\<option>, \<value>: a command-line option with the corresponding value (see "Command-line options" below).

##### Examples:

`java -jar quiltflower.jar -hes=0 -hdc=0 c:\Temp\binary\ -e=c:\Java\rt.jar c:\Temp\source\`

`java -jar quiltflower.jar -dgs=1 c:\Temp\binary\library.jar c:\Temp\binary\Boot.class c:\Temp\source\`

### Command-line options
To force saving as a file or folder, `--file` and `--folder` can be provided. If not specified, Quiltflower will try to guess based on the file name.

With the exception of mpm, urc, ind, thr and log, the value of 1 means the option is activated, 0 - deactivated. Default 
value, if any, is given between parentheses.

Typically, the following options will be changed by user, if any: hes, hdc, dgs, mpm, ren, urc, ind, thr, tlf, tco
The rest of options can be left as they are: they are aimed at professional reverse engineers.

           should be renamed and provides new identifier names (see "Renaming identifiers")

### Renaming identifiers

Some obfuscators give classes and their member elements short, meaningless and above all ambiguous names. Recompiling of such
code leads to a great number of conflicts. Therefore it is advisable to let the decompiler rename elements in its turn, 
ensuring uniqueness of each identifier.

Option 'ren' (i.e. -ren=1) activates renaming functionality. Default renaming strategy goes as follows:
- rename an element if its name is a reserved word or is shorter than 3 characters
- new names are built according to a simple pattern: (class|method|field)_\<consecutive unique number>  
You can overwrite this rules by providing your own implementation of the 4 key methods invoked by the decompiler while renaming. Simply 
pass a class that implements org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.main.extern.IIdentifierRenamer in the option 'urc'
(e.g. -urc=com.example.MyRenamer) to Fernflower. The class must be available on the application classpath.

The meaning of each method should be clear from naming: toBeRenamed determine whether the element will be renamed, while the other three
provide new names for classes, methods and fields respectively.
